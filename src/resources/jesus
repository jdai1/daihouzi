Thoughts on Christianity

What are the main points that people who preach Christianity are saying?

- Let Jesus into your life
- Jesus died on the cross for our sins
- God and Jesus want to save your soul and they have an unconditional love for you
- Before I let Jesus into my life, I was clubbing, smoking marijuana. I was so anxious all the time. I had suicidal thoughts, I was empty inside

My thoughts
- There is a common human experience that I see in these people's stories. In my own ontology, they are preaching self-love, and forgiveness of self. They are preachign mindfulness and inner peace. In their ontology, they are preaching a trust in God that he loves us. That even if we thought we had no other reason to live in this world, God's unconditional love and patience for us would be enough. 
- What is the equivalent of a relationship of God to an atheist?

Who is God to a Christiain?
God is love, god is mercy, god is grace
God is a reminder for people to be grateful
- I thank god for this meal we are about to eat.
God is a reminder for people that people always have a reason to live.
- God loves you.
God is a reminder to be a good person.
God is a medium for people to attain inner peace and release their anxiety --> God is an extremely powerful concept for Christians.
