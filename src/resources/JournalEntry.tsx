                The past few days have been really rough for me. It’s not like I’ve been insanely swamped with work. It’s just that I don’t want to do any of it. I’m finding less and less motivation to do DL or SWE, especially now that the courses are just about completing projects. I find myself spiraling mentally, but every time I’ve been in this position before, I’ve always recovered. Patience. Life is like a sin wave. Ups and downs are natural, but you have to focus on the things that make you happy. Things that are fun to you. Things and people that you love. Hold them near and dear to you and never let them go, because the moment you do is the moment your life becomes black and white and grey.

                I remember also going through a phase like this in high school. Everyday was bleak. Grey. I thought it was because I didn’t have any real friends but I did. It was really because I had lost the things that I held near and dear to my heart. I hadn’t been enjoying them enough or pursuing them—there is a certain thrill to actively obtaining happiness isn’t there? How did I get out of that slump? I don’t really remember. It kind of just happens doesn’t it? I guess things turned upward with Stone and Sarah and tennis. I had things and people to care about once more that I had sought out. Yellow fuzzy things to chase down. I girl to fuck and love. I guess it really does make a big difference.

                Does that mean I just send it with Isa? To chase down my own happiness? I’m so afraid that my decision won’t be right. I don’t trust that everything will be OK if I just go for it. But it probably will.

                Things to remember:
                - I should really reread my journal entries more. Hopefully now that I’m organizing and digitizing them it will be a lot easier to do that.
